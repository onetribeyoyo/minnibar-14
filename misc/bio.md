With 25+ years of software development experience Andy Miller's expertise is both technical and organizational.  Though he started his computing career using TECO macros to translate programs from PL/1 to VAX basic and spent many years messing around with CLOS, he has recovered and today his technical work most often focuses around the JS & JVM platforms.

Andy received a B.A. in Mathematics and Computer Science from Gustavus and an M.S. in Computer Science from Kent State.  He lives in St. Paul, MN and works at Target on their supply chain transformation.  His professional interests include mentoring, getting the job done, and avoiding nasty surprises.
